# Flutter template

This is my own template created to quickly start a project using `provider` as a state manager and `shared preferences` to store preferences on the device. Also, I included a provider for changing the application's theme, which I find essential for all applications.

## How to use this Flutter template?

You just need to follow these 2 steps:

1. Replace your project's `lib` folder with the template's.

2. Install the following dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` by running the commands below:

* [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
```bash
flutter pub add shared_preferences
```

* [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
```bash
flutter pub add provider
```
